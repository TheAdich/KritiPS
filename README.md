## ðŸš€Working of the Dapp

1. Registration Phase: Before the elections begin, the voters are required to verify their email-id and passwords and after which they connect their metamask wallets.
   The election candidates have to apply for their candidacy before the elections and fill out all the necessary details including their agenda.

2. Election Phase: During the elections, only the registered voters are allowed to choose their candidate and cast their votes, which are stored on the blockchain and become temper proof. The voter cannot edit their vote or re-vote.

3. Results Phase: After the elections end, we read data directly from the smart contracts and declare the winner of the elections.
